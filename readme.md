Hipster Fantasy 3 is a modern-day play on hipster culture that utilizes HTML, Bootstrap 4, a slight sprinkle of custom CSS and a fair amount of JQuery.  It also features a massive amount of soundbites from the original SNES Final Fantasy series (plz don't sue me). 

The game takes place in a coffee shop- a place where all hipsters frequent, and the players featured in this battle are (in no particular order):

1.  Sonic (ranged attack) - The music hipster; he knows all the bands.  
2.  Cyclo (brute force)- She rides a fixie.
3.  Wiz (wizard/magic type)- He's into freelancing.  
4.  Psycho (psychokinetic) - He's really just better at you at everything and says everything he needs with his mind.   

Each character was developed as an object and has their own custom game win dialogue as well as custom attack soundbit when used as the player.  

The goal of the game is quite simple- pick any character you want, but be incredibly particular in which opponent you choose to attack. Attacking increases the base attack of the player, but the counter attacks of the opponents remain the same throughout the game.
